# Wordpress-Mega-Merger
This repository will merge many different websites that were made with different CMS systems or even no CMS into one master website.  Every page will be maintained.   Every URL will be redirected to the new site.  And you can still control all pages via a CMS.  It uses 2 CMS systems: Wordpress and Caddy Templates.
