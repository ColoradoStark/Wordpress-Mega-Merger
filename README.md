# Wordpress-Mega-Merger

This repository will merge many different websites that were made with different CMS systems or even no CMS into one master website. Every page from the sites being merged will be preserved. Every URL will be 301 redirected to the new site. And you can still control all pages via a CMS. To achieve this, it uses 2 CMS systems: Wordpress and Caddy Templates.

Dependencies:
Ubuntu, Docker, Docker-Compose
